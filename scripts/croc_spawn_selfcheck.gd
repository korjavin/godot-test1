## Headless self-check: NO CROCODILE MAY SPAWN INSIDE SOLID STONE.
##
##   godot --headless --path . --script res://scripts/croc_spawn_selfcheck.gd
##
## Prints "SELFCHECK OK" and exits 0, or prints what failed and exits 1 — the
## same shape as prop_selfcheck.gd / landmark_selfcheck.gd, and it exists for the
## same reason those do: every way of breaking this looks like ordinary scenery
## from the outside. A crocodile wedged in a block is not an error anywhere — it
## is a body the physics server shoves out sideways, or one that stands in a wall
## biting a player who cannot reach it, in a world where nothing logs anything.
##
## THE THREE SPAWNERS AND WHAT EACH RELIES ON, because they are not alike:
##
##   * spawn_crocodiles_in_chunk (ground) rejects candidates within
##     `ob.radius + min_object_clearance` of every footprint in `obstacles`.
##   * spawn_bosses_in_chunk walks BOSS_PLACE_TRIES candidates against the same
##     list with a per-scale clearance, because a 6x boss needs ~4.2 m.
##   * spawn_platform_crocodiles gets NO obstacles at all. It is handed walkable
##     tops and trusts their declared geometry — which is exactly where this
##     check earns its keep, and where the bug it was written for lived: a wall
##     ridge declared its surface at the SINGLE-block height while 30% of its
##     sections are DOUBLED, so a guard dropped in at surface + spawn height
##     landed inside a hump whenever the random angle picked one.
##
## HOUSE RULE, followed throughout: every check is an EFFECT measurement against
## the chunk's REAL collision shapes — the CollisionShape3D children of its
## BlockCollision body — never a read-back of the declared footprints, because
## the declared footprints are precisely what a bug here gets wrong. Every check
## has a negative control beside it, since "no crocodile was in stone" is also
## true of a sweep that generated no crocodiles, no stone, or no doubled wall.
##
## Cost: the whole file is ~2 s for 2 seeds x 289 chunks. Don't grow it into a
## suite; if a fourth spawner appears, it belongs in check 1's sweep, not in a
## new file.

	"""
	Generate a FIELD x FIELD chunk field and measure every crocodile against the
	solid geometry around it.

	The terrain node is DETACHED (never added to the tree), the same way
	prop_selfcheck.gd and landmark_selfcheck.gd drive it: _ready() rolls a random
	run seed, awaits a frame and starts streaming chunks around the player, none
	of which this check wants. set_run_seed() is the public seam that makes the
	field reproducible (it is also what new_run() and the multiplayer forced seed
	go through, so it cannot rot), and the two scenes are assigned by hand because
	_ready() is what normally loads them.

	TWO PASSES, and the split is load-bearing: a block near a chunk edge reaches
	into the NEIGHBOURING chunk, while `obstacles` only ever describes the chunk
	being generated. So every chunk's geometry is built first and each crocodile
	is then measured against its own chunk AND its eight neighbours, in world
	space. A single-pass version passes while a crocodile stands in the corner of
	the wall next door.
