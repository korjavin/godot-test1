## Endless Terrain Generator
##
## This script creates an "endless" field by generating terrain chunks
## around the player and removing chunks that are far away.
##
## EDUCATIONAL NOTES:
## - This uses a technique called "chunk-based terrain generation"
## - Chunks are created/destroyed dynamically based on player position
## - This is how games like Minecraft create infinite worlds!

# ============================================================================
# SECTION 1: TERRAIN CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

## Size of each terrain chunk (in meters)
## Larger chunks = fewer chunks needed, but more memory per chunk
@export var chunk_size: float = 50.0

## How many chunks to render around the player in each direction
## Higher values = you can see further, but more GPU/CPU usage
@export var render_distance: int = 5

## Reduced render distance used ONLY on the web (WebGL) build (see _ready()).
##
## WHY WEB GETS A SMALLER VIEW:
## render_distance is squared into the number of active chunks — desktop's 5 means
## (2*5+1)² = 121 chunks live at once, each carrying a ground mesh, a block MultiMesh,
## a block-collision body, ~10 crocodiles and some coins. In a browser that is a LOT
## of draw calls, physics bodies and AI to keep alive, and it's the single biggest CPU/
## GPU cost. Dropping to 3 means only (2*3+1)² = 49 chunks — roughly 2.5× fewer chunks,
## i.e. ~2.5× fewer crocodiles/bodies/draw calls to simulate and render every frame.
## That's the largest single web performance win in this plan.
##
## The catch is that a smaller view normally reveals the "edge of the world" — the last
## ring of chunks just stops, with sky beyond it. We hide that edge with depth fog (set
## up below in _ready, web only) coloured like the sky horizon, so the nearer world edge
## dissolves into the sky and the field still FEELS endless. Desktop keeps the full 5
## and never gets fog, so it is visually unchanged.
##
## TUNABLE: 3 is a good default. If the visible world feels too tight in the browser,
## bump this to 4 (and, if you do, you may want to lower the fog density a touch so the
## fog still sits just inside the new, larger view).
const WEB_RENDER_DISTANCE: int = 3

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WEB-ONLY DEPTH FOG (masks the reduced view distance — see _setup_web_fog)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## Fog colour: the sky horizon grey from main.tscn's ProceduralSkyMaterial
## (sky_horizon_color ≈ 0.646, 0.656, 0.671). Matching the horizon makes the fogged-out
## world edge blend seamlessly into the sky instead of reading as a coloured haze.
const WEB_FOG_COLOR: Color = Color(0.646, 0.656, 0.671)

## Exponential fog density. The reduced web view reaches render_distance(3) ×
## chunk_size(50) = ~150 m to the nearest chunk edge and ~175 m to the far corner, so we
## want visibility to fade out around there. 0.005 gives roughly ~150–250 m of visibility
## (exponential fog has no hard cutoff — it thickens with distance), which tucks the chunk
## boundary into the haze without fogging the playable area near the player.
## TUNABLE: raise toward 0.006 for a closer/denser edge, lower toward 0.004 for a more
## open feel (or if you bump WEB_RENDER_DISTANCE to 4).
const WEB_FOG_DENSITY: float = 0.005

## Terrain height variation (for future procedural generation)
## Currently we use a flat plane, but this allows for hills/valleys
@export var terrain_height: float = 0.0

## The material to apply to terrain chunks
## You can customize this in the Godot editor!
@export var terrain_material: StandardMaterial3D

## Enable/disable object spawning on terrain
@export var spawn_objects: bool = true

## Number of objects to spawn per chunk (approximately)
## Higher values = more cluttered terrain
@export var objects_per_chunk: int = 12

## Minimum distance between objects (in meters)
## Higher values = more space for player movement
@export var min_object_spacing: float = 5.0

## Object size range (random between min and max)
@export var object_size_min: float = 1.0
@export var object_size_max: float = 2.5

## Chance (0..1) that a chunk gets one "feature" structure — a wall, a corridor,
## or a Mayan step-pyramid — for variety. Kept moderate so structures show up
## often enough to be interesting but the field doesn't feel crowded.
@export var structure_chance: float = 0.5

## How many blocks long a wall / corridor is (random between min and max).
@export var wall_min_length: int = 4
@export var wall_max_length: int = 7

## Chance (0..1) that a scattered block gets extra blocks stacked on top of it,
## so the terrain occasionally has little towers instead of only single cubes.
@export var stack_chance: float = 0.25

## Maximum number of extra blocks stacked on top of a stacked block.
@export var stack_max_extra: int = 2

## Enable/disable crocodile spawning on terrain
@export var spawn_crocodiles: bool = true

## Number of crocodiles to spawn per chunk
## Higher values = more dangerous terrain!
@export var crocodiles_per_chunk: int = 10

## Minimum distance between crocodiles (in meters)
@export var min_crocodile_spacing: float = 3.0

## How much clear space (in meters) to keep between a crocodile and the nearest
## block. This stops crocodiles from spawning partially buried inside blocks.
@export var min_object_clearance: float = 1.5

## Chance (0..1) that a given walkable structure top (pyramid apex / wall ridge)
## gets a rare crocodile patrolling it. Kept moderate so they're an occasional
## surprise, not on every structure.
@export var platform_crocodile_chance: float = 0.4

## Enable/disable collectible coin spawning on terrain
@export var spawn_coins: bool = true

## Coin placement heights (metres). Coins live on the COIN ROAD (see the section
## below), not scattered per chunk, so there are only two cases now:
## - road coins float just above the grass, grabbed by walking over them
## - when the road runs over a climbable block, the coin perches this far above
##   that block's top surface instead of being buried (see spawn_coins_in_chunk)
const COIN_GROUND_HEIGHT: float = 0.9
const COIN_BLOCK_OFFSET: float = 0.6

## Extra clearance (metres) added to a block's footprint radius when deciding whether
## a road coin sits "over" that block. The ~1 m margin makes the test hug slightly
## WIDER than the block itself, so a coin grazing a block's edge perches on top rather
## than clipping into the side. Shared by _point_over_block and the perch loop so the
## overlap rule has exactly one definition (see _block_overlaps).
const COIN_BLOCK_OVERLAP_MARGIN: float = 1.0

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# COIN ROAD CONFIGURATION (the meandering parametric trail that carries coins)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## EDUCATIONAL NOTE — what "the coin road" is and why it is built this way:
## Instead of scattering coins randomly per chunk (no direction, no journey), all
## coins live on ONE continuous road that snakes across the infinite world and
## always trends forward along +X. The road is a *parametric* path: we sample it
## at integer "station" indices `k` (one coin candidate per station). Station 0
## sits at the world origin (where the player spawns) heading straight along +X,
## so the player is on the road the instant the game starts.
##
## The whole shape is a PURE, DETERMINISTIC function of the station index `k` and a
## single fixed seed (ROAD_WORLD_SEED) — there is NO per-chunk RNG and NO per-frame
## state in the geometry. That is what lets the trail line up seamlessly across
## chunk seams and regenerate byte-for-byte identically when a chunk is revisited.
##
## The path is built by integrating a heading angle station-by-station (see the
## recurrence in _road_extend_to_x). A gentle restoring pull and a hard heading cap
## (< 90°) keep the centerline's X STRICTLY INCREASING in `k`, so a chunk's X-range
## maps to a bounded, contiguous range of stations — which is what makes per-chunk
## coverage finite and seam-correct. The road still reads as a real road with broad
## curves, zig-zags and steep diagonal bends; it just never reverses net direction.

## World-metres between consecutive coin "slices" along the road centerline (the STEP
## of the path). Each slice scatters a few coins across the band, so this sets how often
## a new clump of coins appears as you travel — NOT the gap between individual coins.
## Larger = sparser road.
@export var road_coin_spacing: float = 6.0

## The coin BAND width (metres) varies smoothly between these bounds. Coins are scattered
## at RANDOM lateral offsets within ±band/2 of the centerline (NOT on a single line), so
## the road reads as a swath of territory a few coins wide rather than a conga-line. Bump
## these up for a wider, more spread-out trail; down for a tighter path. (~10–20 m shows
## roughly 3–4 coins across at the default density.)
@export var road_width_min: float = 10.0
@export var road_width_max: float = 20.0

## Coins CONSIDERED per slice, and the chance each one actually spawns. Average coins per
## slice = road_coin_slots * road_coin_chance. Lower the chance for a sparser, less obvious
## trail; raise it (or the slots) for a denser swath. Keeping the average near ~1 makes the
## band feel like scattered territory, not a carpet. Skipped slots are what give the road
## its irregular, "not so obvious" look.
@export var road_coin_slots: int = 3
@export var road_coin_chance: float = 0.4

## Maximum per-station heading jitter magnitude (degrees). Larger = curvier / tighter
## zig-zags. This is the amplitude of the deterministic turn noise added each station.
@export var road_turn_rate_deg: float = 18.0

## Heading cap measured from the +X axis (degrees). The integrated heading is clamped
## to ±this. MUST stay < 90° so cos(heading) is always > 0 and the centerline's X
## keeps increasing with `k` (asserted in _road_extend_to_x). 78° still allows steep,
## road-like diagonal bends while guaranteeing forward progress.
@export var road_max_heading_deg: float = 78.0

## Heading restoring pull toward +X applied every station BEFORE the turn noise:
## heading *= (1 - ROAD_RESTORE). Without it the random turns would random-walk the
## heading and pin it against the cap; this gentle pull keeps the road trending
## forward and gives it a natural "return to course" feel after a bend.
const ROAD_RESTORE: float = 0.06

## Fixed seed mixed into the per-station hash for the CENTERLINE so the road is stable
## run-to-run yet distinct from the per-chunk object/crocodile seeds (it is its OWN
## world). Pick any constant; changing it reshapes the entire road's path.
const ROAD_WORLD_SEED: int = 0x5_0AD  # "ROAD"-ish; arbitrary fixed constant

## Separate fixed seed for the per-slice COIN SCATTER RNG (the lateral/along-road jitter
## and the per-coin spawn chance). Kept distinct from ROAD_WORLD_SEED so reshaping the
## scatter doesn't move the centerline, and vice-versa.
const ROAD_COIN_SEED: int = 0xC0_1A  # "coin"-ish; arbitrary fixed constant

## How fast the band width breathes (radians of cos() per station). Lower = the band
## swells wide and narrows over MORE stations. At 0.08 the cosine's period is
## ~2π/0.08 ≈ 78 stations, so the width cycles slowly enough to feel smooth, not pulsey.
const ROAD_WIDTH_FREQ: float = 0.08

## Fraction of road_coin_spacing a coin may jitter ALONG the road from its slice center
## (±this × spacing). Without it, every slice's coins would sit on the same cross-line
## and the eye would read regular rows; this staggers them so the swath looks organic.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# COIN ROAD STATION CACHE (the integrated centerline, computed once, never reset)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## The road centerline is sampled at integer station indices `k`. Each cached entry
## is a Dictionary { center: Vector2, heading: float }, where `center` is the
## centerline position in world (x, z) coordinates — note we pack WORLD Z into the
## Vector2's `.y` field — and `heading` is the integrated heading angle (radians)
## from +X used to step to the NEXT station.
##
## We key the cache by `k` in a Dictionary (NOT a contiguous Array) so that extending
## the road in the -X direction is O(1) per station: an Array would force `push_front`,
## which shifts every existing element (O(n) per insert → O(n²) over a long backward
## walk). A Dictionary insert is O(1) and an index lookup `road_stations[k]` is O(1),
## regardless of how far the road has grown either way. The cache still holds a
## CONTIGUOUS range [road_k_min, road_k_max]; it just doesn't pay the array-shift cost.
##
## The cache grows from station 0 outward in BOTH directions (forward for k>0, backward
## for k<0) as chunks request coverage, and is NEVER invalidated — the road is static
## and infinite, and every station is a pure function of `k` + the fixed seed, so a
## cached value is correct forever and independent of load order.
var road_stations: Dictionary = {}

## Inclusive station-index bounds of what `road_stations` currently holds. They start
## "empty" (min > max); the first _road_extend_to_x seeds station 0 and sets both to 0.
var road_k_min: int = 1

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SHARED RESOURCES FOR MULTIMESH BLOCK RENDERING (created once, reused forever)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## EDUCATIONAL NOTE — what a MultiMesh is and why we use it here:
## Previously every decorative block was its own MeshInstance3D with its OWN
## BoxMesh and its OWN StandardMaterial3D. With ~12 scattered objects + stacks +
## big feature structures per chunk and 121 active chunks, that is *thousands* of
## separate meshes and materials — and the GPU has to issue a separate "draw call"
## for each one. Draw calls are expensive (especially in a browser/WebGL), so this
## is the main thing that makes the web build stutter.
##
## A MultiMesh fixes this. It is ONE mesh (a single unit cube) drawn MANY times in
## a SINGLE draw call. Each "instance" gets its own Transform3D (so we can scale +
## rotate + move the unit cube to land exactly where a block should be) and its own
## per-instance Color (so each block keeps its individual earthy colour). One
## MultiMeshInstance3D per chunk therefore renders every block in that chunk with
## essentially one draw call instead of dozens — a huge win, with no visual change.
##
## We keep TWO resources shared across ALL chunks (creating them once avoids
## re-allocating identical resources for every chunk):
##   1. a unit (1×1×1) BoxMesh — the geometry every instance reuses; per-instance
##      scale in the transform stretches it to each block's real dimensions.
##   2. a StandardMaterial3D with `vertex_color_use_as_albedo = true` — this tells
##      the shader to use each instance's per-instance Color AS its albedo, so the
##      single shared material still paints every block its own earthy colour.

## Lazily-created shared unit BoxMesh (size 1×1×1). The MultiMesh instance
## transforms carry the per-axis scale, so this single cube becomes every block.
var _shared_unit_box_mesh: BoxMesh

## Lazily-created shared material for the block MultiMesh. `vertex_color_use_as_albedo`
## lets one material show each instance's individual colour. Per-instance roughness
## is NOT supported by MultiMesh (only transform + color are per-instance), so we
## bake a single representative roughness here (0.85, mid-range of the old
## 0.7–1.0 spread). The visual difference is negligible.
##
## COLOUR SPACE: we leave `vertex_color_is_srgb` at its default (false) on purpose —
## the Compatibility (web) renderer IGNORES that flag, so we can't rely on it. Instead
## create_box pre-converts each instance colour with `srgb_to_linear()` before storing
## it, so the per-instance colour is already linear and matches what the OLD
## `albedo_color` (sRGB→linear) path produced. See the COLOUR SPACE note in create_box.
var _shared_block_material: StandardMaterial3D

## A representative roughness for the shared block material. The old per-block code
## picked a random roughness in [0.7, 1.0]; since MultiMesh can't vary roughness
## per instance, we use one mid-range value for all blocks. (We still CONSUME the
## same RNG call in create_box so the deterministic world layout is unchanged.)

	  in the world; the body itself doesn't move (static). Godot's physics engine
	  collides against each individual SHAPE — at that shape's own world transform —
	  regardless of whether the shapes are spread across many bodies or grouped under
	  one. The OLD code put each block's shape at the block's transform via the BODY's
	  position/rotation (shape sat at the body's local origin). The NEW code puts that
	  same transform directly on the CollisionShape3D node instead (it's a Node3D, so
	  it has its own position/rotation), giving the shape the IDENTICAL world placement.
	  So the player still can't walk through a block, and a crocodile's avoidance
	  raycast still hits it, byte-for-byte as before — we've only changed how the
	  collision nodes are GROUPED, not where any collision surface is. The payoff is
	  ~25× fewer nodes for blocks (one body per chunk instead of one per block), a real
	  CPU/web win with zero behavioural change.

	  The MultiMesh (block_batch → MultiMeshInstance3D) and this collision body are the
	  TWO HALVES of each chunk's blocks: one renders them, one collides with them.

	@param parent_chunk: The chunk mesh. NOTE: create_box itself no longer uses this — the
	                   visual goes to block_batch and the collision shape attaches to
	                   block_body (which create_chunk parents to the chunk). It's kept only
	                   to match the uniform (parent_chunk, ..., block_batch, block_body)
	                   signature shared by every spawn_*/create_* helper, so all the call
	                   sites pass the same argument list. (Not used for "future" plans.)
	@param center_pos: Box centre position, local to the chunk (Y is the centre,
	                   so pass height/2 to sit a box on the ground)
	@param dimensions: Full box size on each axis (width, height, depth)
	@param yaw: Y rotation in radians (0 to keep faces axis-aligned)
	@param rng: The chunk's seeded RNG, used for the random earthy colour
	@param block_batch: Out-param; we append this block's per-instance transform +
	                   colour here for the chunk's MultiMesh.
	@param block_body: The chunk's single shared StaticBody3D; we add this block's
	                   CollisionShape3D child to it (see WHY note above).

	# ----- Pick the earthy colour (UNCHANGED logic) ------------------------------
	# IMPORTANT (determinism): the chunk's world layout is seeded from this same RNG.
	# If we changed how many random numbers we draw here, every later block/crocodile/
	# coin in the chunk would shift. So we keep the colour draws EXACTLY as before
	# (same randi_range(0,2) branch, same randf_range ranges), and we still consume
	# the roughness randf_range below even though the MultiMesh uses one shared
	# roughness — preserving the RNG sequence keeps the world identical.
	var chosen_color: Color
	var color_choice := rng.randi_range(0, 2)
	match color_choice:
		0:  # Brown rocks
			chosen_color = Color(
				rng.randf_range(0.3, 0.5),

			)

	# Still DRAW the roughness random value to keep the RNG sequence identical to the
	# old code (so the procedural world is unchanged). The value itself is discarded:
	# MultiMesh can't vary roughness per instance, so the shared material uses one
	# representative roughness (SHARED_BLOCK_ROUGHNESS). The visual difference between
	# a fixed 0.85 and the old 0.7–1.0 spread is negligible. We DON'T store the result —
	# the CALL must stay (it advances the RNG), but the value is unused, so calling
	# randf_range purely for its determinism side effect is enough.

	# ----- Append this block to the chunk's MultiMesh batch (VISUALS) ------------
	# A MultiMesh instance is just a Transform3D applied to the shared UNIT cube.
	# We build the basis as: rotate around UP by `yaw`, THEN scale each LOCAL axis by
	# `dimensions` — so the 1×1×1 cube becomes a (w, h, d) box turned by yaw. The
	# transform origin is `center_pos`, which is LOCAL to the chunk (same convention
	# the old per-block MeshInstance3D.position used). Because the MultiMeshInstance3D
	# is parented to the chunk at local origin, these local transforms land the blocks
	# in exactly the same spots as before.
	#
	# WHY `scaled_local` (NOT `scaled`): the order of scale vs rotation matters.
	#   * `Basis.scaled(dimensions)` post-multiplies each ROW → it scales in the
	#     PARENT/global frame, composing as `S * R`.
	#   * `Basis.scaled_local(dimensions)` scales in the basis's OWN/local frame
	#     (after the rotation), composing as `R * S`.
	# The collision path below builds a BoxShape3D sized to `dimensions` on a
	# CollisionShape3D that is THEN rotated by `yaw` — i.e. local-space scale, `R * S`.
	# We match that here with `scaled_local` so the rendered box and its collision
	# shape share the EXACT same transform. For an axis-aligned cube or a yaw of 0 the
	# two orders are identical, so every block in the game today looks the same either
	# way; but for a FUTURE non-uniform block at a non-zero yaw, `S * R` would shear /
	# mis-scale the visual relative to the (unchanged) collision shape — a latent
	# desync. Using `scaled_local` keeps visual and collision in lockstep for all cases.
	#
	# COLOUR SPACE (must match the old look exactly): the OLD per-block code set
	# `StandardMaterial3D.albedo_color = chosen_color`, and Godot treats albedo_color as
	# sRGB — it converts sRGB→linear before lighting, which slightly DARKENS the value.
	# A MultiMesh per-instance colour, however, is fed straight into the shader as the
	# vertex colour: with `vertex_color_is_srgb = false` (the default, and the ONLY
	# value the web/Compatibility renderer honours) that sRGB→linear step is skipped, so
	# the raw colour would render brighter/washed-out — a visible regression on desktop
	# AND web. To reproduce the old albedo output renderer-agnostically, we convert the
	# colour to linear OURSELVES here (`srgb_to_linear()`) so the final linear albedo
	# equals srgb_to_linear(chosen_color), exactly as the old material produced. This is
	# a pure value transform on an already-computed Color — it consumes NO RNG, so the
	# deterministic world layout is unchanged.

	- A coin's offset from the centerline is bounded by band/2 (lateral) plus

	Lay this chunk's slice of the COIN ROAD — the single continuous, deterministic

	The road centerline is a pure, deterministic function of the integer station index
	`k`. Each station then SCATTERS a few coins at random offsets within a band around
	the centerline (see _road_coins_at), so the trail reads as a loose swath of territory
	a few coins wide — not a single line — while still being a clear "go this way" route.
	Off-road areas get NO coins. Everything is seeded only from `k` (+ the road seeds), so
	it regenerates byte-identically and is seam-correct.

	@param chunk_pos: Chunk coordinates this body is generating coins for.
	@param parent_chunk: The chunk mesh the coins attach to (it sits at the chunk
	                     center, so we store coin positions chunk-LOCAL — relative to

	EDUCATIONAL NOTE — why this is seam-correct (no gaps, no duplicates):
	- The road is global and station-indexed, but each chunk generates independently.
	  A station whose coin lands exactly on a chunk seam must be spawned by EXACTLY
	  one chunk. We guarantee that by bucketing each coin to the chunk its FINAL world
	  position falls in: `world_to_chunk(coin_world) == chunk_pos`. Every other chunk
	  that scans the same station skips it, so it is spawned once and only once.
	- Because |heading| < 90° keeps the centerline's world X strictly increasing in
	  `k`, a chunk's X-range maps to a CONTIGUOUS range of stations. We extend the
	  shared station cache to span this chunk's (widened) X-range, then scan it.
	- Off-road is empty: only stations whose coin actually lands inside this chunk
	  spawn anything, so far-from-road chunks spawn zero coins.
