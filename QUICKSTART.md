# Quick Start Guide 🚀

Get up and running in 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Install Godot

Download Godot 4.3 or later from: https://godotengine.org/download

## Step 2: Open the Project

1. Launch Godot
2. Click **Import**
3. Navigate to this folder
4. Select `project.godot`
5. Click **Import & Edit**

## Step 3: Run the Game

Press **F5** or click the Play button (▶️)

## Controls

- **WASD** - Move
- **Space** - Jump
- **Shift** - Run
- **Ctrl** - Duck
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **ESC** - Release/capture mouse

## What's Next?

1. **Explore the code**: Open `scripts/player_controller.gd` - it's heavily commented!
2. **Read the tutorial**: See `docs/TUTORIAL.md` for customization guides
3. **Understand the architecture**: Check `docs/CODE_STRUCTURE.md`
4. **Experiment**: Try changing values like WALK_SPEED or JUMP_VELOCITY

## Quick Tweaks to Try

### Make the character faster:
Edit `scripts/player_controller.gd`:
```gdscript
const WALK_SPEED: float = 10.0  # Was 5.0
const RUN_SPEED: float = 20.0   # Was 10.0
```

### Jump higher:
```gdscript
const JUMP_VELOCITY: float = 15.0  # Was 8.0
```

### Change gravity (simulate moon!):
```gdscript
var gravity: float = 1.6  # Moon gravity!
```

### Change terrain color:
Edit `scripts/endless_terrain.gd` in the `_ready()` function:
```gdscript
terrain_material.albedo_color = Color(0.8, 0.6, 0.4)  # Sandy!
```
